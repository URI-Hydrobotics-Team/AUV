Requirements
============

This ROS package is accompanying the *Stonefish* library, which requires a modern multi-core processor to run the physics calculations in realtime.

A discrete graphics card (GPU) with the support for **OpenGL 4.3 or higher** is required to run graphical simulations.

Dependencies
============

The following dependencies have to be installed prior to building the package:

* `Stonefish <https://github.com/uri-ocean-robotics/stonefish>`_ (C++ library)

.. note::
    The link above redirects to URI Ocean Robotics fork for stonefish.
    Visit https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish for original copy of stonefish library.

Building
========

Clone the code of the package to your catkin workspace and build as usual. No additional steps are required.
