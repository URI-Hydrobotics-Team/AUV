This is a small program that demonstrates basic communication using UDP sockets.

Before compiling it, you may want to edit port.h and set a
(hopefully unique for your environment) default port number
(in the range 1024...65535).

Then run make to compile it. It should work fine on linux or OS X systems.
(on solaris systems, you may need to add /usr/ccs/bin to your PATH environment)

1. Start the server
In one window, run
	./udp-recv

The server runs forever, listening for UDP packets on a port defined in port.h.
Each time a message is received, it is printed.
Break out of it via ^C (or whatever your interrupt character is).

2. Client
In another window, run the client:
	./udp-send

As it's written, the server's address is set to 127.0.0.1, a 
special address for the local host, so the client and server should be on
the same machine if you don't change the address.
