# AUV
The old repository containing Tardigrade's custom software solution. 

# Overview
Prior to Fall 2025, Tardigrade was to use a custom and fully independent robotics middleware suite (auv-hub and then AVOE). Tardigrade's implementation of AVOE would live here. However, for various reasons, we have chosen to move to ROS for RoboSub 2026. This repository still contains useful code, especially driver related, and should be considered a resource. Development of AVOE has been suspended but not canceled.
