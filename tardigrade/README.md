# Tardigrade

!! This is no longer the .md for installation, access, setup, etc etc. That has been moved to [Tardigrade Setup Docs](../Tardigrade%20Setup%20Docs/), I will overtime try to expand it and try to containerize everything as cleanly as possible. 

## Description

This package serves as the primary package, files located here include: simulator code, general scripts such as cmd_vel_to_thruster, and other metadata for utilizing MVP. You can also find all the simulator dependencies in the stonefish_mvp directory.
