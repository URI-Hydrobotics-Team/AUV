# What is this?
This is a repo for our custom software the powers the Tardigrade AUV. While this is not based on ROS, we are currently transitioning to using ROS for the RoboSub competition. While this may be used in other AUVs, it is specifically desgined for Tardigrade. The code base is in heavy development and is not refined at the moment, one a minimum viable product has been developed, the refining process will occur.
## Overview
- Sensor Drivers (pigpio based)
- auv-hub (a crude AUV control suite used for 2025's competition)
- Computer vision fragments
- Fragmented and sparse documentaton
- pi-pico-comm-control (MicroPython script for initializing and controling thrusters


# Installation
Each directory includes either a makefile or a build.sh script. cmake will be fully adopted in the future.
# Requirements
TODO
# History
